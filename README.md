From the initial Robot Car project, we progressed towards developing a remotely controlled vehicle, significantly enhancing its functionality. Initially, we utilized an unlicensed control application. Subsequently, we developed a customized application equipped with specialized control buttons, including a dedicated 'return home' button, allowing the vehicle to autonomously navigate back to its point of origin. The project, titled 'Development of an Experimental Vehicle Model', was awarded first place in the prestigious 'Scientific Communications Session' competition. I collaborated with a colleague as part of a team for this competition.
